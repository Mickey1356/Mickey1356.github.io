Hi and welcome to my site!

Currently, I am an undergraduate student in [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg) with a focus track in Artificial
Intelligence and Cybersecurity.

If you want to see what work I've done, check out my [projects](/projects).

Otherwise, you can check out my [posts](/posts), or whatever other miscellaneous thing I'm up to in [Others](/others).

I'm not super used to how Jekyll works though, so there might be issues here and there. Feel free to contact me if you
spot anything!
