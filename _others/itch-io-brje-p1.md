excerpt: Attempting to review every game in this bundle
---

So, in 2020, [itch.io](https://itch.io) hosted a [bundle](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) with over **1000** different games in support of the #blacklivesmatter movement. All proceeds went to the [NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/), as well as the [Community Bail Fund](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd).

Well, one fine day in 2021, when I was feeling especially bored, I thought, why not try to review every game available on the bundle?

So, here we are!

To avoid overloading this site, I've created a Google Docs to collate the reviews. You can view my thoughts [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qNxuWxCy0jK7LbTek1yxxy0Z_1G3Ka4LVXFWPp3_hcw/edit?usp=sharing).
