excerpt: Attempting to review every game in this bundle
---

So, in 2020, [itch.io](https://itch.io) hosted a [bundle](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) with over **1000** different games in support of the #blacklivesmatter movement. All proceeds went to the [NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/), as well as the [Community Bail Fund](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd).

Well, one fine day in 2021, when I was feeling especially bored, I thought, why not try to review every game available on the bundle?

So, here we are!

To avoid overloading this site, I'm using itch.io's Collections to maintain this list. You can view my thoughs [here](https://itch.io/c/1383711/racial-justice-bundle-a-play-through)!
