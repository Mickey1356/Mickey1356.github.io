*(Ripped from the Github page)* A 2-Player Couch Co-op Space Ship Game made by Game Design Club (for SUTD Open House 2019). Each player controls half the Space Ship for some multiplayer chaos.

I implemented the enemies as well as designed the sprites for the enemies, bullets and player.

There's an introductory poster (as well as the source) on the [Github page](https://github.com/Mickey1356/HalfAndHalf).
